# Small Game-Like App 
A game (?) for experimenting with modules in JS and it was going to be a game but then I just 
abandoned it as it was supposed to be more of learning JS. I was going to follow a tutorial and 
I did but the code I wrote was way more modular.

To run it, make sure to gave Python installed and then do,
``python3 -m http.server 910`` 
or 
``python -m http.server 910````

# Getting this project
