Gets Coronavirus Information

Some of the code may be different from the video as most of the code in the repository was posted way before the video and I modified some of the code in the video to make it more efficient and better


To clone this repository just type 'git clone https://github.com/DevHedronYT/WebDev.git', if that does not work just download the zip by clicking on the green 'Code' button
 
Or just download the zip by clicking on the code button on the top right

Then navigate to the folder of this file

To run, just run the main.py script, also please have Beautiful Soup, and Kivy installed and also have Python 3.x.x

If you are on mac, to run the main.command file just click on it, if it does not run and says you do not have permission or something, go to your terminal and type, 'chmod +x main.command', and then click on it and try running it, also the main.command file may be a little different. To run the program on Windows you will have to type 'python main.py' in you Command Prompt window
